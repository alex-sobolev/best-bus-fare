<h2>Task</h2>
<p>
Write a program that excepts a single parameter,
an array of integers from 0 to 30. Those numbers are days in a month.
</p>
<p>
Find a best possible monthly fare if:<br>
daily pass: 2 dollars;<br>
weekly pass: 7 dollars (it's really a 7-day pass; it can start on any day,
and it's valid for 7 consequtive days from the day of purchase);<br>
monthly pass: 25 dollars.
</p>
<p>
subtask for me: <br>
write the program without using for loops. use recursive algorithms instead
</p>
